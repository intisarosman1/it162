        <p>Website monetization is an opportunity that allows you to make money through websites you create. Websites don’t only have to be a means to be viewed for information and shared; they can be profitable too! The only requirements to make a passive income through this are a website, maintenance, and strategy.</p>
        <p>One of the methods of monetizing your website is affiliate marketing with affiliate links. By promoting products and services on your website for your viewers to click on, you can make a small commission. These goods might be from another company but it is best for you to make sure that they are of good quality. A method similar to this is providing sponsored content, whether it’s in posts or product reviews. This allows you to delve into social media sponsorships where you get paid for every purchase you refer.</p>
        <p>Another method is through Google Adsense and other PPC (pay per click advertising) options. There are sites that pay a small amount per click. Google Adsense works by showing relevant ads to your viewers. The two important factors to keep in mind are traffic and ads network. A similar method is working together with the businesses you will promote by selling ad space to them.</p>
        <p>Selling your own digital info products is another great way to monetize your website. These can be ebooks, papers, apps, templates, illustrations, and other digitally distributable content. You can even sell an e-course which customers have to pay to tune into. Viewers and potential customers are charged for access to the content. You can expand your products outside of digital info and into physical products as well. This is a great method overall because through this, you can gain access to your viewer’s emails as well. You can use this opportunity to make an email list, which can be monetized as well.</p>
        <p>Many websites depend on donations to stay up. Accepting donations from your viewers is always an option for making some more money off your website. If views are willing to contribute donations, you can cover your website’s maintenance and more. </p>
        <p>Another method is setting up an e-commerce website to sell your products and services. An online shop allows you to display them all in one place. Once you have the relevant niche unique to your website, you can pull in customers from your viewers. This method is very much creating your own business as you’ll be taking orders and sending them to the customers. Any services you monetize can be from areas of expertise that you are capable of.</p>
        <p>Creating a paid membership for your website is another method to make a recurring income. By paying a fee, viewers can get inside access to what you have to offer, whether it is content they get to unlock with their membership, discounts and special features, or participation in private discussions and more.</p>
