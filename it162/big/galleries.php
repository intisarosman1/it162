        <p>A way web developers display images is with responsive image galleries. These can be coded with HTML, CSS, or Javascript (jQuery). Galleries are important in presenting images with a neat, appealing, and engaging approach. Thanks to the Internet, there are resources and tools that can be used to help make galleries.</p>
        <p>The CSS language alone is enough to create a minimal image gallery. With pure CSS, you can create a basic and simple gallery or with a grid type layout. You can add popups with additional info or make a horizontal slideshow. You can also pair CSS and HTML together to make galleries.</p>
        <p>Another popular way to create galleries is with jQuery. When it comes to jQuery sliders, Shah at Cloudinary has a list of efficient ones. He mentions ResponsiveSlides.js, a small plugin which makes a responsive slider with the elements in a container. The images used are the same size. BXslider is a popular, fully responsive slider that is supported on Github. Iit contains images, video, or HTML and incorporates animation with CSS transitions. Another popular and full responsive slider is Slick. It scales with its container and is swipe enabled, meaning it can support navigation by mouse-dragging and arrow-keys. WooThemesFlexslider 2 is another fully responsive slider, featuring multiple sliders, including horizontal/vertical sliders, fade animations, callback API, hardware-accelerated touch-slide support, and customizable navigation options. It comes with intuitive markup and supports all major browsers. Swiper is a touch slider meant for mobile websites, apps (including native and hybrid) and it comes with transitions that are hardware-accelerated. Super Simple Slider is a  simple and small responsive, browser friendly slider that is compatible with all HTML and has arrow key support. Another slider is Animate Slider, a plugin that offers many element-specific animations, including delay. 365 Web Resources provides many slider resources. Among them are Touch-slider, iosslider, SudoSlider, hipsterSlider, OwlCarousel, TosRUs, ferroSlider, RTP Slider, Tiny Circleslider, Ion.Image Slider, roundabout, Carousel, unslider, and Microfiche.</p>
