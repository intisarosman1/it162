        <p>When it comes to content on devices, there are different approaches to accessing and displaying it effectively the way users want. These two approaches are responsive websites and mobile applications. Both have their advantages and flaws. Each design could be more helpful for specific uses if the points are considered.</p>
        <p>According to research, users spend significantly more time using the mobile app version rather than the mobile website versions of content (Oza). Additionally, 51% of all internet traffic worldwide is found to be on mobile devices (Cherednichenko). This proves people tend to use mobile platforms to consume information. Not only that, because of the offline feature mobile apps, they can be used without an Internet connection. Mobile apps allow for better performance, consistency in design, and integration of device features, such as the camera, microphone, bluetooth, QR codes, location, notifications, and etc. They also let users personalizate and customize the app according to their needs. Despite all this, mobile apps fall short because they can only stick to the device’s operating system and require a download of the app unlike responsive websites that just require a specific link to be followed. </p>
        <p>The responsive website design has pros of its own. It is easier to build and cheaper overall. Unlike apps that require users to install updates, all a website needs is new code to be added and hosted to the interface by the owner and after that it’s ready for viewers to continue using. Also, websites can be accessed on any device and platform. They can be quickly found across various search engines, rather than being limited to an app store like mobile apps. However, all of this requires an Internet connection and an optimized version for mobile websites. Additionally, responsive websites only have limited access to the device’s features.</p>
